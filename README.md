About
=====
This project is to reimplement my MUD scripts so they aren't so embarrasing to
share with friends. With that in mind I need to give some credits. At some
point during the 1.x releases of Tintin++ I was referencing the scripts from
the website that Scandum has made public domain. My own work is available under
the WTFPL.
